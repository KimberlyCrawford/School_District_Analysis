# School_District_Analysis
with Pandas

## Project Overview
A chief data scientist for a city school district is responsible for the following tasks:
- analyzing information from a variety of sources and formats
- preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation
- providing insights about performance trends and patterns to the school Board, so decisions can be made about student funding and test scores.

## Resources
- Data Sources: schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv
- Software: Conda 4.10.3, Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Pandas, and NumPy

## Summary 
The list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district: 

- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:

### Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate

## Challenge Overview 
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Challenge Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

### Math and reading scores by grade
### Scores by school spending
### Scores by school size
### Scores by school type

## Challenge Summary 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
1. Change 1
2. Change 2
3. Change 3
4. Change 4
